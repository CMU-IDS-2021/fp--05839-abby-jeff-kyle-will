"It’s good that you all focused on a narrower topic. The new premise seems pretty compelling, especially the 
addition of analysis around “what are we going to do about it.” I like the addition of analyzing sentiment over 
countries. It does seem more tricky to come up with compelling visualizations for some parts. Suggestions for 
communicating orders of magnitude (5:06): Watch the film “Powers of Ten,” and check out this vis of Jeff Bezos’s 
wealth. https://mkorostoff.github.io/1-pixel-wealth/ When it comes to showing perception v. reality in media, I 
recommend avoiding word clouds, as they take up a lot of space and don’t give much information. A simple list of 
topics would do. It’s easy to slip on the definition of what AI is. For the lay reader, I would recommend 
defining AI precisely. "
