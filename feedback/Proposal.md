## Feedback: Project Proposal

This document summarizes some of the feedback we received on our initial project proposal, and our thoughts on how we might address it.

### Reviewer 1 Feedback

**Comments**

- Insufficient enumeration of data sources for the project.
- Questions whether the project presents a realistic scope, or at the very least their ability to judge the scope given the lack of data source enumeration.
- Strong narrative for one topic may be more compelling than a weaker narrative for three.
- Machine superintelligence and nuclear weaponry likely imply significantly different types of data sources.

**Suggestions**

- Come to the design review with concrete data sources identified.
- Come to the design review with some initial data analysis performed.
- Choose a single topic on which to focus (e.g. machine superintelligence OR nuclear weaponry).

### Reviewer 2 Feedback

**Comments**

- Compelling project idea if we can pull it off.
- Proposed large goals without concretely identifying data sources.

**Suggestions**

- Narrow to a single topic (e.g. machine superintelligence OR nuclear weaponry).
- Suggest focus on nuclear weaponry as the primary topic of the project.

**Questions**

- As we construct this narrative, how do we intend to keep the reader from feeling overwhelmed or hopeless?

### Reflection

The general thrust of the feedback is clear: we came in with ambitious goals and a compelling agenda, but not a lot of concrete data to back it up. This is an accurate assessment. However, it is still to early (read: we have not yet done the legwork) to conclude whether the lack available data is a result of its absence or merely our inability to locate it.

The reviewers both suggest that we narrow to a single topic within the larger topic area of global catastrophic risk. There are legitimate arguments both in favor and in opposition to modifying our project topic in this way.

**Retain Current Focus**
- A primary argument for retaining our current focus is _this is the narrative we want to tell_. That is, our focus is not necessarily on the specific sources of risk, but rather on the fact that we (humanity) live in the presence of a non-trivial level of global catastrophic risk as a product of our own undertakings. This is the story! How did we get here? How did we allow this to happen? How do we get out of our current predicament? Should we want out of it at all, or is it in some way inevitable or necessary for progress? These are the types of questions that we initially set out to address in this project, and these are better answered in the context of a project that maintains a broader focus on global catastrophic risk in the aggregate rather than one particular source. That said, we might have to make a concession and recognize that while this might be _our_ objective, it may not cleanly fit into the requirements for this particular class project.
- Another reason we want to tell the story of global catastrophic risk is that it is one that receives relatively little attention. Individual topics, ecological destruction in particular, have had their time in the sun, but the larger controlling concept of global catastrophic risk is far from a mainstream term. Our contributions in this project might legitimately help to bring more attention to the subject.
- Revisiting the first bullet above: perhaps we didn't make it clear in our proposal (certainly failed to do so in the presentation) that our primary focus should not be thought of as an amalgamation of three distinct sources of global catastrophic risk, but rather as a project whose primary focus is global catastrophic risk and merely cites these specific sources of risk as necessary supporting evidence. Would this change the tune of the feedback? Perhaps not, again as a result of the fact that the projects in this class are expected to fit into a particular mold.

**Narrow Focus**
- Narrowing the focus of the project to a single topic certainly makes coming up with adequate data easier.
- Narrowing our focus might also simplify the process of constructing a cohesive narrative.
- One issue we might encounter with a broad focus on global catastrophic risk is losing readers to "doomsday fatigue" (I just came up with that phrase, catchy?) as the second reviewer suggests. After reading about how we (humanity) is doomed as a result of advances in machine superintelligence, what will make them want to continue reading about the risks of nuclear weaponry? Obviously this is a gross oversimplification of the argument we plan to make, but the heart of the issue still stands.
