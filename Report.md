**Abstract**: Machine intelligence stands to become one of the most disruptive innovations of our generation, imposing consequence that will span many diverse fields of human endeavor: technological, social, political, and ethical. In this project, we present a data-driven narrative regarding the development of machine intelligence the and its implications for humanity. We contribute a streamlit application that guides users through the often-complex space of machine intelligence potential, ongoing coverage from both popular and academic sources, and the current state of national attention to the subject. Users should come away with a better understanding of _why_ machine intelligence matters, _where_ the technology currently stands, and _what_ we as a society are (and are not) doing to prepare for its arrival.

### Introduction

Machine intelligence, and the prospect of machine superintelligence, is one of the most consequential issues of our generation. While it stands to reason that machine intelligence might prove remarkably beneficial to humanity, there is also a non-negligible probability that its inception might spell the end of life as we know it.
