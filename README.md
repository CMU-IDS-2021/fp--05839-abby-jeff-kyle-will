**Track**: Narrative

**Running the Application**: To run the application, simply click the "Online URL" link shown above. This will navigate the user to the web application hosted with Streamlit. The application will load fully functional and ready for use. The user can read through the narrative and explore the main visualizations. The sidebar provides more options for the user to explore other visualizations in various sections. For an overview of the app and some of the additional visualizations available, see the short video provided in the link above which provides a demonstration of the application.

## Abstract 

Machine intelligence stands to become one of the most disruptive innovations of our generation, imposing consequence that will span many diverse fields of human endeavor: technological, social, political, and ethical. In this project, we present a data-driven narrative regarding the development of machine intelligence the and its implications for humanity. We contribute a streamlit application that guides users through the often-complex space of machine intelligence potential, ongoing coverage from both popular and academic sources, and the current state of national attention to the subject. Users should come away with a better understanding of _why_ machine intelligence matters, _where_ the technology currently stands, and _what_ we as a society are (and are not) doing to prepare for its arrival.

## Work distribution

**Abby Vorhaus** - Developed the high level application structure to include the main page structure and the sidebar setup. Created visualizations for the primacy of intelligence, the potential of mechanical minds, and the prospects for machine intelligence sections as well as the narrative for the prospects for machine intelligence. Standardized the color palette to add to the cohesive design. 

**Jeff Moore** - Performed web scrapping to pull articles from various sources in order to perform sentiement analysis on articles and papers relating to machine intelligence. Utilized sentiment analysis to observe trends both research and public perception over time. Developed the narrative and visualizations in perceptions versus reality.

**Kyle Dotterrer** - Concieved the idea for the application, and performed the inital research to determine its feasibility. Constructed the narrative concept and tied the various visuaizations and concepts together in a cohesive flow. Wrote the final report for the project. Developed the timeline visualization.

**Will Borom** - Performed web scrapping to pull articles from various sources in order to perform sentiement analysis on articles and papers relating to machine intelligence. Developed visualizations in the potential of mechanical minds and in responses to machine intelligence. Developed the narrative and case study in responses to machine intelligence.
